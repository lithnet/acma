# ACMA
Lithnet ACMA is a codeless rules engine for Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM). ACMA provides a means for performing powerful rules-based construction of objects and attributes without the need to write custom code.

ACMA is implemented as an extensible management agent (ECMA2.2), built upon a SQL Server database, and comes with a powerful UI-based rules editor and PowerShell extensions.

## System Requirements
ACMA requires Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 or later, SQL Server 2016 or later, and PowerShell 3.0 or later.

## Getting started
Download both the management agent and ACMA editor from the [releases page](https://github.com/lithnet/acma/releases)
