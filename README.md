# ACMA
Lithnet ACMA is a codeless rules engine for Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2. ACMA provides a means for performing powerful rules-based construction of objects and attributes without the need to write custom code.

ACMA is implemented as an extensible management agent (ECMA2.2), built upon an SQL Server 2012 database, and comes with a powerful UI-based rules editor and PowerShell extensions.

## System Requirements
ACMA requires FIM 2010 R2 at least version 4.1.3441, SQL Server 2012, and PowerShell 3.0.

## Getting started
